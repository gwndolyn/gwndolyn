## Design Process
This is a personal portfolio website that contains more information about myself. It allows me to keep track of my performance and collate them in this website. The user audience are job recruiters who are interested in finding more about the user. This website allows the employer to find information about the owner quickly and able to highlight the skills they are good at easily. They can then leave their messages for the owner from the website. This would allow them to make their decision whether to hire the user or not. 
## Features
The navigation bar has different buttons that brings you to the different pages or the website (eg. experiences, skills, projects and contact me). 
The navigation bar stays at the top when scrolled to ensure users to have easy access to the menu.

Javascript is used to signal when the bar should stick. (eg. after scrolling pass "My Portfolio", the bar should stick to the top)

At the bottom of each page there is a home button that leads users back to the "About Me" page for convienence.

The social media icons allow users to be directed to the owner's social media websites in a new tab.

The "Get in Touch" box allows users to send their messages to the owner. 

Javascript is used so that when they click submit, a pop-up will appear, thanking the user. However, the button is currently mock and does not send the message anywhere.
